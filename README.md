# Universal Project Instructions Template

This folder contains a set of generic instruction files for data science and analytics projects. The goal is to provide a reusable, organization-agnostic framework for coding standards, workflows, and best practices that can be easily adapted to any team or environment.

## Contents
- `copilot-instructions.md`: Main repository-wide guidelines and maintenance rules
- `instructions/`: Path-specific instructions for notebooks, plotting, Python standards, testing, and user preferences
- `prompts/`: Reusable prompt templates for agentic workflows (e.g., stepwise script optimization)

## How to Use
1. **Copy this folder** into the `.github/` folder of your project.
2. **Customize placeholders** in each file to match your domain, team, and technical stack (e.g., time conventions, style files, language preferences).
3. **Update the files** as your team's practices evolve. See the maintenance guidelines in `copilot-instructions.md` for details.

## Key Features
- Organization-agnostic: No references to specific companies, domains, or folder structures
- Modular: Each file covers a distinct aspect (notebooks, plotting, Python, tests, user communication)
- Extensible: Add new instruction files as needed for your workflows
- Proactive improvement: Guidelines encourage regular review and updates based on actual project practices

## Recommended Workflow
- Start with the main `copilot-instructions.md` for repository-wide rules
- Use the path-specific instructions for detailed standards in notebooks, plotting, Python code, and tests
- Adapt the user instructions to your team's language and communication style
- Use the prompt templates to automate and standardize code review and optimization processes

## Maintenance
- Keep the folder structure and references up to date as your project evolves
- Propose updates to instruction files when you identify recurring patterns or new best practices in your codebase
- Periodically review and refine the business context and technical guidelines
